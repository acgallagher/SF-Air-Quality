# San Francisco Orange Week Air Quality Vizualization

This project extracts air quality data from the PurpleAir API for the week of 9/9/2020 to 9/16/2020 - the week when San Francisco's sky became orange. The goal of the project is to determine if, and to what extent, different neighborhoods experienced the wildfire smoke in different intensities.
